    author: "Foodies Pakistan",
    body: "To understand whether dietary supplementation is good for our health or not, we must first understand what it truly is. Unless we have a sound understanding of it, we will continue to have no option but trust the doctor’s prescription blindly.If we consider the literal meaning, then dietary supplementation refers to any capsule, tablet, pill, chewable, or syrups that contain a dietary element. It could possibly be any amino acid, vitamins, minerals, etc. One can even consume it in the form of a nutritional bar. Note that any form of dietary supplements must only be ingested via the mouth into the body. Otherwise, it may not classify as a dietary supplement. Nutritional supplements that one takes in the form of nasal sprays, creams, lotions, etcetera are not dietary supplements but drugs.Also, dietary supplements are not supposed to substitute meals. Proper food intake, such as liquids, fruits, vegetables, meats, etc. remains necessary. The supplementation can only boost nutrient intake.",

    title: "How To Bake Without An Oven?",

    body: "Primarily, the Tandoor originated from South, Central, and Western Asia. Although it serves the same function in all cases, it comes in different shapes. At times, you’ll see a tandoor, which is nothing but a wall surrounded by blazing flames upon which the baker sticks the bread dough and waits for it to bake thoroughly.Other than that, it is metal over or a cylindrical clay pot. In all cases, the convection heat phenomenon comes into use for cooking and baking goods at around 480°C. Although in the present times, it’s not the best approach towards baking, you can still make one at home if you like. Also, goods baked in Tandoor may smell a bit of charcoal or smoke.Perhaps, the most convenient approach in baking without an oven is using a microwave. Almost all of us have a microwave in the present times that we use only to heat the frozen or chilled food. One can even bake whole bread, pizza, cakes, brownies, and all other stuff in it.But you will have to take care of a few things before experimenting with microwave-baking. Firstly, know your microwave’s type. If it uses a convection heating mechanism, then it works like an oven, and you can use standard baking pans and tins in it. Also, you will not need to use altered recipes or increase baking time. However, the other regular microwaves require the use of microwave-safe baking pans. And also, you may need to increase baking time depending on the recipe. In these, it’s best to go with prepared baking batters.",
